## 1 Sample Tutorial Code: Understanding PINNS and IPINNS
1 - This example covers Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNS) and Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks (IPINNS) for a damped harmonic oscillator. Due to formatting issues, the tutorial is hosted on nbviewer. Click [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/stephenbrutch/PINNS-and-IPINNS/blob/main/pinn_pytorch.ipynb) to view the tutorial.
